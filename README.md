# ParsiLaTeX Code Save
A Firefox ADD-ONS which saves the code section of the [ParsiLaTeX](qa.parsilatex.com) by double-clicking.
It also supports StackExchange Network.

# Introduction

[ParsiLaTeX](parsilantex.com) group supports  Persian users of TeX/LaTeX by preparing packages, slides, books, and some other stuff around how to typeset with TeX/LaTeX in Persian. It targets people from Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan who write in Persian scripts. One of the facilities that [ParsiLaTeX](parsilantex.com) provides for their users is a Question and Answer site similar to [StackExchange](tex.stackexchange.com) but the communication language there is Persian. As you know, the Q&A site includes lots of code blocks in their question or answer parts. The process of copying the code text would be very time-consuming and this `firefox extension` tries to address this issue.
